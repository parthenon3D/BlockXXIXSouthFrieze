# Block XXIX South Frieze

Marble relief (Block XXIX) from the South frieze of the Parthenon. The frieze shows the procession of the Panathenaic festival, the commemoration of the birthday of the goddess Athena. Block XXIX represents a team of horses, with flickering manes, pulling a chariot. A fragment of the chariot wheel is in the Acropolis Museum, Athens. Metal reins, which are now lost, were inserted in drill-holes. For more information on the chariot-race see South frieze Block XXV. The explosion of the Parthenon in 1687 damaged the South frieze the most.

## Methodology used
